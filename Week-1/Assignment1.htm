<p> 1. What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?
 &nbsp;   <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A protocol stack refers to a group of protocols that are runnning concurrently that are employed for the implementation of network protocol suite. 
<br>  The protocols in a stack determine the interconnectivity rules for a layered network model such as in the OSI or TCP/IP models.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A web service protocol stack is a protocol stack (a stack of computer networking protocols) that is used to define, locate, implement, and make Web services interact with each other.
The two types of protocol stack are 1) User Datagram Protocol (UDP)  2) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

<p> 2. What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?
 &nbsp;   <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Web Server: Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Web servers are computers used to store HTTP files which makes a website and when a client requests a certain website, it delivers the requested website to the client.

 &nbsp;   <br> <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apache HTTP server: It is the most popular web server and about 60 percent of the world’s web server machines run this web server. The Apache HTTP web server was developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an open-source software which means that we can access and make changes to its code and mold it according to our preference. The Apache Web Server can be installed and operated easily on almost all operating systems like Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.
 &nbsp;   <br> <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): IIS (Internet Information Services) is a high performing web server developed by Microsoft. It is strongly united with the operating system and is therefore relatively easier to administer. It is developed by Microsoft, it has a good customer support system which is easier to access if we encounter any issue with the server. It has all the features of the Apache HTTP Server except that it is not an open-source software and therefore its code is inaccessible which means that we cannot make changes in the code to suit our needs. It can be easily installed in any Windows device.
 &nbsp;   <br> <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lighttpd: Lighttpd is pronounced as ‘Lightly’. It currently runs about 0.1 percent of the world’s websites. Lighttpd has a small CPU load and is therefore comparatively easier to run. It has a low memory footprint and hence in comparison to the other web servers, requires less memory space to run which is always an advantage. It also has speed optimizations which means that we can optimize or change its speed according to our requirements. It is an open-source software which means that we can access its code and add changes to it according to our needs and then upload our own module
 &nbsp;   <br> <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jigsaw Server: Jigsaw has been written in the Java language and it can run CGI (common gateway interference) scripts as well as PHP programs. It is not a full-fledged server and was developed as an experimental server to demonstrate the new web protocols. It is an open-source software which means that we can access its code and add changes to it according to our needs and then upload our own module
 &nbsp;   <br> <br> 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sun Java System: The Sun Java System supports various languages, scripts, and technologies required for Web 2.0 such as Python, PHP, etc. It is not an open-source software and therefore its code is inaccessible which means that we cannot make changes in the code to suit our needs.

<p> 3. What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?
&nbsp;   <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients, i.e. it offers the facilities required for them to create and maintain a site and makes it accessible on the World Wide Web. Companies providing web hosting services are also called web hosts.
 <br>  <ol>
  <li>Shared Hosting</li>
  <li>VPS hosting</li>
  <li>Dedicated Hosting</li>
  <li>Managed WordPress hosting</li>
  <li>Colocation Hosting</li>
</ol>

<p> 4. What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?
&nbsp;   <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scalability is the potential of your application to cope with increasing numbers of users simultaneously interacting with it. Ultimately, it is to grow and be able to handle more and more requests per minute (RPMs).
 Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands
<br> <br> Horizontal scaling (aka scaling out) refers to adding additional nodes or machines to your infrastructure to cope with new demands. If you are hosting an application on a server and find that it no longer has the capacity or capabilities to handle traffic, adding a server may be your solution.
<br> <br> Vertical scaling (aka scaling up) describes adding additional resources to a system so that it meets demand. How is this different from horizontal scaling?
While horizontal scaling refers to adding additional nodes, vertical scaling describes adding more power to your current machines. For instance, if your server requires more processing power, vertical scaling would mean upgrading the CPUs. You can also vertically scale the memory, storage, or network speed.

<p> 5. What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?
&nbsp;   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines such as Google. Because search is one of the main ways in which people discover content online, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in traffic to a website.
<br> &nbsp; These below steps can help to improve your website SEO.
 <br>  <ol>
  <li>Understand your online customers.</li>
  <li>Use keywords on your website.</li>
  <li>Refresh your page content often.</li>
  <li>Gain referrals from other websites.</li>
  <li>Use meta tags in your content.</li>
  <li>Stay up to date on the latest SEO techniques.</li>
